These files are the mplus input and output files corresponding to the latent profile analyses in WP1_SimpView_LPA_composite.Rmd. 

Naming conventions:
sv_lpa_*_*class: the initial Simple View Latent Profile Analyses, conducted across several model specifications (a-e) and different numbers of classes (1-10).
lpa_*_lmr_*class: the (V)LMR tests run using the optseed value identified for the best loglikelihood above, for all models. 
sv_lpa_*_rerun_*class: the bootstrapped LRTs run using the optseed value identified above, for a small set of candidate models. Class probabilities are also saved.
